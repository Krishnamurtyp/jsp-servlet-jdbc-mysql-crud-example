Followed this tutorial: JSP Servlet JDBC MySQL CRUD Example Tutorial (https://www.javaguides.net/2019/03/jsp-servlet-jdbc-mysql-crud-example-tutorial.html)


Followed Java Guides tutorial on CRUD Example.
Since I had to push this project to the repository, leaving my credentials publicly visible is a security risk, so instead I've used SYSTEM ENVIROEMENT VARIABLES to avoid hard-coding them.
The app is not very good leyered, but the purpose is just to show how CRUD can be done.
